so for ssh; i generate a key using keygen and then copy the public key geerated to server and keep private key with me.....so whenever i login since i haev the private key to server; only i can login now; suppose i share this key to semeone and he uses ssh server@domain -i privatekey; then he can login the same way as mine ; without any password?

Yes, you're exactly right — and here's a breakdown to confirm your understanding and clarify a few details:
🧠 How SSH Key-Based Authentication Works

    You generate a key pair:

ssh-keygen

This creates:

    A private key (e.g., id_rsa) — keep this secure and secret.

    A public key (e.g., id_rsa.pub) — this can be shared freely.

You copy the public key to the server using:

ssh-copy-id user@server

or manually placing it in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys on the server.

When you SSH into the server:

ssh user@server

or

    ssh -i /path/to/private_key user@server

    SSH uses your private key to prove your identity. The server checks if your private key matches one of the public keys in its authorized_keys.

🔐 If You Share Your Private Key

If you share your private key with someone else, yes — they can SSH into the server exactly like you can, without being prompted for a password, unless additional protections are in place.

So:

ssh -i id_rsa user@server

will log them in just like you — because the server can’t tell the difference. It's trusting the key, not the person.
🛡️ Security Implications

Sharing your private key is like giving someone your password — and worse, because SSH keys often allow passwordless access and can be reused without detection.

To prevent misuse:

    Never share your private key.

    Use a passphrase when generating keys (ssh-keygen prompts you for this).

    Use chmod 400 to restrict access to the private key.

    If compromised, remove the public key from the server's ~/.ssh/authorized_keys or rotate keys.



so basically if i wanna connect to a server; i generate keys in my system; then copy public key on server and login using the private key i have;  if i share the private key with someone; he gonna use the same login  as me too.
